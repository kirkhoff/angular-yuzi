<h1 class="example-h1">Accordion</h1>
<p>The example below uses static text defined in a controller, but the accordion directive also supports
<a href="https://angular-translate.github.io/" target="_blank">angular-translate</a>. Navigate to the accordion src
in Github for documentation on how to implement angular-translate and string interpolation.</p>
<p>Note that the view all button is expecting a translation to be in place, and what you see is a string id.</p>
<example style="position:relative">
  <accordion items="$ctrl.questions"
             label="question"
             value="answer"></accordion>
</example>
